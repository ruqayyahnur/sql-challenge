# Background
As a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard, you are task with doing a research project about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and the 1990s. You have been provided with the remains of the employee database from that period through six CSV files.

For this project, you need to design the tables to hold the data from the CSV files, import the CSV diles into a SQL database, and display the information requested. 

# Data Engineering
Inspect the CSV files and sketch an Entity Relationship Diagram of the tables. The sketch could be reated using the QuickDBD tool.

# Data Engineering
Create a table schema for each of the six CSV files.
  - Remember to specifiy the data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and any other contraints.
  - for primary keys, verify the column is infact unique. Otherwise, a composite key is need to take the two primary keys to uniquely identify a row.
Import each CSV file into it corresponding SQL table.

# Data Analysis
